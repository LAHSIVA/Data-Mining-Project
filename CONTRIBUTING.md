We make an effort to follow the [Scikit-learn's contributing guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html) and [The Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

### Contributors:

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project.

### Automated Contributions Policy
Please refrain from submitting issues or pull requests generated by fully-automated tools. Strictly, don't submit code that you do not understand.

Ideally, contributions should follow from a human-to-human discussion in the form of an issue.

### Submitting a bug report or a feature request
We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests; feel free to open an issue if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

It is recommended to check that your issue complies with the following rules before submitting:

1. Verify that your issue is not being currently addressed by other issues or pull requests.

2. If you are submitting a bug report, we strongly encourage you to follow the guidelines in How to make a good bug report.

### How to make a good bug report
When you submit an issue to GitHub, please do your best to follow these guidelines! This will make it a lot easier to provide you with good feedback:

1. The ideal bug report contains a [short reproducible code snippet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/minimal_reproducer.html#minimal-reproducer), this way anyone can try to reproduce the bug easily. If your snippet is longer than around 50 lines, please link to a Gist or a GitHub repo.

2. If not feasible to include a reproducible snippet, please be specific about what estimators and/or functions are involved and the shape of the data.

3. If an exception is raised, please provide the full traceback.

4. Please include your operating system type and version number, as well as your Python, scikit-learn, numpy, and scipy versions.

5. Please ensure all code snippets and error messages are formatted in appropriate code blocks. See [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) for more details.

### Contributing code

To maintain the quality of the codebase and ease the review process, any contribution must conform to the project’s coding guidelines, in particular:

1. Don’t modify unrelated lines to keep the PR focused on the scope stated in its description or issue.

2. Only write inline comments that add value and avoid stating the obvious: explain the “why” rather than the “what”.

3. Most importantly: Do not contribute code that you don’t understand.
